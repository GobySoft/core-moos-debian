Description: Cross Platform Software for Robotics Research. 
 From An Overview of MOOS-IvP and a Users Guide to the IvP Helm Autonomy Software (http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/57583): MOOS is often described as autonomy "middleware" which can be argued is shorthand for the glue that connects a collection of applications where the "real" work is going on. MOOS does indeed connect a collection of applications.... 
 However, each application inherits a generic MOOS interface whose implementation provides a powerful, easy-to-use means of communicating with other applications and controlling the relative frequency at which the application executes its primary set of functions. Due to its combination of ease-of-use, general extendability and reliability, it has been used in the classroom by students with no prior experience, as well on many extended field exercises with substantial robotic resources at stake.
